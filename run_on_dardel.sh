##### Some additional, potentially useful flags:


## --skip_premapping_dedup
# By default, a a pcr deduplication step is run first on the raw reads, and then again on the mapped reads in the bam file.
# in modern data with reasonably low levels of duplication rates (say, < ~ 30 %), this is most likely redundant and could potentially even
# lead to over-deduplication and loss of data. So for modern, high quality data, this flag is recommended.

## --conda_cachedir
# by default, the conda environments created by the piepline will be stored in the .envs directory in the current working directory.
# If intending to run the pipeline several times, you can save some time and space by setting this to a dedicated location that
# you can then reuse for subseqeunt runs in different directories. Then, the environments doesn't need to be recreated.

## --use_mamba
# if you have a local installation of mamba, this argument will save some time when creating the conda environments. 
# mamba is not available as a module on dardel, so the default is to use conda.

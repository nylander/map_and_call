##### Some additional, potentially useful flags:

## --skip_premapping_dedup
# By default, a PCR deduplication step is run first on the raw reads, and then
# again on the mapped reads in the bam file. In modern data with reasonably low
# levels of duplication rates (say, < ~ 30 %), this is most likely redundant and
# could potentially even lead to over-deduplication and loss of data. So for
# modern, high quality data, this flag is recommended.

## --conda_cachedir
# By default, the conda environments created by the piepline will be stored in
# the .envs directory in the current working directory.  If intending to run
# the pipeline several times, you can save some time and space by setting this
# to a dedicated location that you can then reuse for subseqeunt runs in
# different directories. Then, the environments doesn't need to be recreated.
# See also the NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR variable above.

## -work-dir
# To save disk-file quota, one may try to write the work directory to a
# temporary folder.  For example: `-work-dir "$SNIC_TMP"/map_and_call`
